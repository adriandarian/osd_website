## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Step 1: Commit and Push

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with CI setup message
git commit -m "ci: setup GitHub Actions workflows and documentation"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Watch First Deployment

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
4. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**
3. Save

Your site will be available at: `https://adriandarian.github.io/osd_website/`

### Step 4: Test a Pull Request

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/workflow-check

# Make a small change
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md

# Commit and push
git commit -am "test: verify workflows"
git push origin test/workflow-check

# Open a PR on GitHub
# Watch all checks run automatically
```

4. ✅ Deploy automatically
5. ✅ Site is live!

### On Every Pull Request:
1. ✅ Run lint checks (oxlint)
2. ✅ Run type checking (TypeScript)
3. ✅ Run test suite (Vitest)
4. ✅ Build verification
5. ✅ Lighthouse performance check
6. ✅ Bundle size report
7. ✅ Content validation (if content changed)

### Every Monday at 9 AM UTC:
1. ✅ Check for dependency updates
2. ✅ Run tests with new versions

## 🎯 Performance Budgets

Your workflows enforce these quality standards:

| Metric | Budget | Enforcement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Lighthouse Performance** | > 85 | Error on PR |
| **Lighthouse Accessibility** | > 95 | Error on PR |
| **Lighthouse Best Practices** | > 90 | Error on PR |
| **Lighthouse SEO** | > 95 | Error on PR |
| **Initial JS Bundle** | < 100KB | Warning on PR |
| **First Contentful Paint** | < 2s | Warning on PR |
| **Largest Contentful Paint** | < 2.5s | Warning on PR |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift** | < 0.1 | Error on PR |
| **Total Blocking Time** | < 300ms | Warning on PR |
| **Speed Index** | < 3s | Warning on PR |

## 🔍 How to Monitor

### View Workflow Runs
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on a workflow
3. See all runs with status
4. Click run to see logs

### Check Performance Reports
- Lighthouse CI comments on PRs
- Bundle size shown in PR checks
- Detailed reports in workflow artifacts

### View Test Results
- Test summary in PR checks
- Coverage reports (when run)
- Failed test details in logs

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running?

**Check:**
- Push was to correct branch (`main` for deploy)
- Files are in correct location (`.github/workflows/`)
- YAML syntax is valid
- Repository has Actions enabled (Settings > Actions)

### Deployment Failed?

**Common Issues:**
1. **Build error**: Run `bun run generate` locally to debug
2. **Missing dependencies**: Verify `package.json` is correct
3. **Permission error**: Check workflow permissions in YAML
4. **Pages not enabled**: Go to Settings > Pages

### Tests Failing?

```bash
# Run locally to debug
bun run test

# Watch mode for interactive debugging
bun run test:watch

# Check coverage
bun run test:coverage
```

### Performance Budget Exceeded?

**Solutions:**
1. **Optimize images**: Use @nuxt/image with WebP/AVIF
2. **Code split**: Lazy load heavy components
3. **Tree shake**: Remove unused dependencies
4. **Analyze bundle**: Run `bun run analyze`
